# GenSketch

**This is a pre-alpha project which is not functional yet (and may never be).** GenSketch is a
genomics data viewer heavily inspired by IGV. As compared to existing viewers, GenSketch aims to
provide more powerful interactive editing functionality.

## Planned Features

- Drag and drop reads to different genomic locations to see how they align.
- Cutting/splicing/inverting read sequences (e.g to visualize structural rearrangments).
- Manually arrange specific reads in a sketchpad track to produce figures for publication.

## Roadmap

### 0.2.0

- Basic SAM/BAM visualization

### 0.3.0

- Initial sketchpad functionality with support for dragging and dropping reads

### 0.4.0

- Extra sketchpad functionality (exclude/cut/copy)
